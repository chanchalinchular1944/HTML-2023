        <h1 class="cold">Not Feeling Cool ?</h1>
        <p> I'm a firm believer in the fact that every single one of us thinks that we are in fact "cool". I think, or are you dying to be the cool girl, who flows through life ease and grace? If you think about all the people who you think of as cool, you'll find what they have several chracterristic in common they're all confident, unique, and on friendly terms with everyone. There's no reason you can't be like that yourself.</p>
        <h2> Act Like You Don't Care</h2>
        <p>We will always, on some level, he concerned with other's opinions of ourselves, but realize that ultimately, you will never bea ble to please everyone, so why bother trying? People have millions of ways to get under your skin. Learn to spot them and become  immune. Be happy and have fun.</p>
        <h2>Learn to Laugh...At You!</h2>
        <p>Being cool doesn't mean being perfectt, and being able to find humor in your moments of clumsiness and discomfort is the defining hallmark of being cool. People will not only respect you for it, but they'll like you for eing human, just like them.</p>
