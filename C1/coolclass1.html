        <h1>Defination of cool</h1><br>
        <p>I'm a firm believeer in the fact that every single one of us thins that we are in fact "cool". I think, err, thno, that I am cool because of the clothes that i wear, my hair is cool, what i do is cool, how i do things, etc. Everything about me is sheer and utte coolness! I live cool and I breathe cool. I even bleed cool. I'll bet that I am way cooler than you. How do I hnow this? Well, because I am cool. Simple. right!</p><br>

        <h2>Calculate Cool</h2>
        <p>5% aspiration+ 95% self-perception + 10% public awareness + 46% individuality + 15% actions + 22% verbal + 99% what others think about you. Wait, this doesn't add to 100%-but I guess that is my point Coolness doesnt't add up to 100 either. </p>
        <h2 class="hot">Ultimate Coolness</h2>
        <p>Being as cool as I am, I am going to go out on a limb ('cause that's what cool people do) and give you my hypothesis of ultimate coolness. Rest assured, the fact that I am starting my opinion makes me genuinely cool, but I gigress momentarily. There is no real tangible coolness. Coolness is  what you think it is. Being cool is how you perceive your world. It is all about your perception. Wannt to  test your coolness(and my theory)? Just go ask someone if they think you are cool. They will look at you kind of funny, quickly think about potentially losing coolness by admitting to themselves that the person asking is, or could be cooler than the person being asked. And of course give you an asnwer-BUT, probably indirectly, such as 'your socks or shirt is cool', or the purgatory of coolness-'maybe', or 'depends'.</p><br>
